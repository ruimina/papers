<p>The 47th edition of IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) will be held on 7-13 May 2022 online, and on 22-27 May 2022 in Singapore with a satellite venue in Shenzhen, China. We are indeed honoured to pen the first words of the ICASSP 2022 proceedings. In the past year, research in signal processing has continued to thrive across Asia and all over the world.  The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our life and work one way or another. But it has not dampened our scientific endeavour and our enthusiasm for ICASSP.  On this occasion, we share with you the excitement of our community as we gather again at our annual conference. Welcome to ICASSP 2022!</p>
<p>Signal processing has never been so important for us. Many of what we do today during the pandemic, including our virtual meetings, benefits from the scientific progress of signal processing and the technologies that we have developed. ICASSP 2022 embraces a theme of human-centric signal processing to underscore the significant contributions of signal processing to humanity. The conference has received more than 4,209 open-call submissions, among the highest in the history. During this unusual time, we are planning a unique conference for our thriving research communities.</p>
<p>Since making the sudden shift to virtual for ICASSP 2020, the conference has adapted to provide virtual options and enhancements for participants. Over the past two years, ICASSP created an environment via Gather.Town with the goal of emanating the in-person experience. During the past two years, as a virtual conference, ICASSP has attracted around 20,000 attendees combined, many of which have been first-timers and some from countries not historically represented at ICASSP. Through engaging social events with live music and entertainment, spontaneous interactions amongst peers, interactive poster sessions, and more, ICASSP has aimed to bring together the global community of attendees, exhibitors, and IEEE Signal Processing members.</p>
<p>As we are embracing a new norm of daily life, and Singapore is opening up its border to the world, we are glad to announce that ICASSP 2022 is run in a hybrid mode to accommodate both online and onsite participation. The onsite option marks the first step towards a return to our tradition of face-to-face meeting. The online option reaffirms our commitment to make the conference the most accessible ever.  While Singapore remains as the main conference venue, we also organize a satellite venue in China where regional delegates can meet each other without crossing the quarantine border.</p>
<p>The conference is honoured to host four keynote speakers, Professor Sergios Theodoridis, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece, Professor Yi Ma, the University of California, Berkeley, USA, Professor Tanja Schultz, the University of Bremen, Germany, and Professor Robert W. Heath Jr. the North Carolina State University, USA. The regular paper sessions, together with 8 grand challenges, and 18 special sessions will make up an extraordinarily rich technical program. We spare no effort to ensure an interactive conference experience in hybrid mode for all technical sessions.</p>
<p>The conference continues its tradition of innovation. It features many new initiatives in 2022. We would like to highlight a brand-new education track, that includes 16 tutorials and 6 training courses given by renowned researchers. It is worth mentioning that we have greatly upgraded the industry track, that includes keynotes, expert sessions, panels, workshops, seminars, show and tell demos. ICASSP 2022 will also host the inaugural Entrepreneurship Forum of IEEE Signal Processing Society to connect technopreneurs, investors and leaders in the start-up eco-system.</p>
<p>ICASSP 2022 is made possible by the dedication and hard work of our community. We are indebted to many. The ICASSP track record of excellence continues this year. This would not have been possible without the advice and support of IEEE Signal Processing Society and the Honorary Chair Tsuhan Chen. Special mention must be made of the fact that ICASSP 2022 is truly international. It is organized by an organizing committee with members from 13 countries and regions. The diversity of our people is one of our core strengths that adds tremendous value to conference organization. We thank all of them for volunteering their time and energy in service to our community.</p>
<p>In particular, we would like to express our gratitude to the Technical Program Chairs Woon-Seng Gan and Kai-Kuang Ma for their leadership in putting together an exciting and high-quality technical program, the Industry Program Chair Fa-Long Luo, the Operations Chair Minghui Dong, the Finance Chairs Yan Wu, and Lei Wang, the Virtual Conference Chair Kong-Aik Lee, and their teams. We also thank the Local Chairs, Yi Zhou, Chitralekha Gupta, Ville Hautamäki, Rosa Hautamäki in Singapore, and Siqi Cai, Li Liu, Zhiyong Wu, Wen Wu, Lei Xie in China for the multi-site coordination.</p>
<p>We are most grateful for the generous sponsorship from the industry, and the overwhelming supports from the supporting organizations. In particular, we thank the Chinese and Oriental Languages Information Processing Society (COLPIS), Singapore Exhibition & Convention Bureau, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), China for providing institutional supports from the proposal to the execution of ICASSP 2022. We also thank NUS, NTU, SUTD, U Bremen, and APSIPA for their contributions to the technical programs.</p>
<p>As a city-state, Singapore may be one of the world’s smallest countries, but it is known for its  great business and tourism infrastructure, the unparalleled international air connectivity, the amazing variety of delicious food due to a rich mix of cultures, and the world-class hotels. Singapore is ready to provide a safe travel and convention offerings to meet the evolving requirements of a post-pandemic world.  As a knowledge-driven economy, Singapore has a vibrant R&D landscape in information and communications technology. The signal processing community is part of the fabric of Singapore’s R&D landscape. We are looking forward to welcoming our friends and colleagues from around the world at ICASSP 2022!</p>
<p>With our best wishes for a successful conference!</p>
