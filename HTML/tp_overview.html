<p>It is our greatest pleasure to welcome all of you to the first tandem-hybrid ICASSP 2022. ICASSP is the world’s largest and most comprehensive technical conference focused on signal processing and its applications. This year’s edition of ICASSP is a departure from the virtual conferences held over the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizing committee, in consultation with the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) board, took a novel, hybrid approach in transiting ICASSP back to having some of its pre-COVID in-person conference components. Since it would be impossible to transit to a full-fledged in-person ICASSP due to the evolving situations and travel restrictions by some countries, the hybrid approach brings everyone to the virtual poster presentation in Gather.Town from 7-13 May 2022, before culminating in the physical in-person conference from 22-27 May 2022 at the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore. Delegates able to travel to Singapore will thus have an additional opportunity to present in front of their peers and interact with participants. This tandem-hybrid arrangement of virtual sessions before in-person sessions also symbolizes the transition from a virtual to a physical conference, after a 2-year hiatus from in-person conferences.</p>
<p>Amidst the pandemic, we are relying more on digital technologies for communication through virtual meetings; personalized entertainment; intelligent health monitoring while in isolation; managing our daily lives through human activity sensing, etc. Hence, in ICASSP 2022, we adopted the theme “Human-centric signal processing”, which plays an ever-important role in our daily activities during this period. This theme features prominently in many of our technical papers and presentations this year, showing how signal processing and artificial intelligence are leading the way in designing solutions that cater to our needs and requirements.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty in COVID situations world-wide, we are extremely pleased that the paper and presentation submissions to ICASSP 2022 have exceeded all expectations. We received a record-high 3,859 regular paper submissions, 108 special session papers, 93 journal presentations, 53 grand challenge papers, 39 industry expert presentation, 32 tutorial submissions, and 25 show-and-tell presentations from more than 70 countries. Altogether, this huge number of 4,209 open-call submissions reflects the unwavering popularity of ICASSP and reaffirms it as the most recognized premium international signal processing conference attracting academics, researchers, industry practitioners, and even venture capitalists worldwide. However, this large number of submissions also posed a great review challenge with a tight schedule to all the 12 technical committees (TCs) under the IEEE Signal Processing Society. Nonetheless, almost 93% of all papers received at least three reviews and we would like to thank the dedication and professionalism of all TC members and reviewers under the leadership of Gael Richard (AASP), John McAllister (ASPS), Alejandro Frangi (BISP), Jong Chu Ye (CI), Annalisa Verdoliva (IFS), Andrea Cavallaro (IVMSP), Zheng-Hua Tan (MLSP), Marta Mrak (MMSP), Wei Liu (SAM), Yu Dong (SLP), Osvaldo Simeone (SPCOM), Monic Bugallo (SPTM) and we eventually accepted 1,721 papers, resulting in the lowest ever acceptance rate of 45% across all TCs. We deeply appreciate the dedication and support of all reviewers in completing this immense review task within such a short period of time. It is the combined SPS community effort that underpins the quality of the technical program. In addition, we would like to give kudos to Fa-Long Luo, the industry program chair, who worked tirelessly in putting together a rich and diverse industry program, which is also a centerpiece of this year’s ICASSP.</p>
<p>The nature of this year’s tandem-hybrid conference format for ICASSP has also allowed us to expand its scope to include 4 distinguished plenary keynote speakers and 4 high-profile industry keynote speakers (from Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Nokia Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co.), who will present a broad range of topics of growing interest:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deep Neural Networks: A Nonparametric Bayesian View with Local Competition by Sergio Theodoridis</li>
    <li>Closed-Loop Data Transcription via Minimaxing Rate Reduction by Yi Ma</li>
    <li>Biosignal Processing for Adaptive Cognitive Systems by Tanja Schultz</li>
    <li>What is Next in Signal Processing for MIMO Communication by Robert Heath</li>
    <li>Building Bridges for the Hybrid Era by Jaime Teevan</li>
    <li>Human-Centric Signal Processing for Consumer Electronics: Technology and Practice by Mike Polley</li>
    <li>The Terahertz Age: Sensing, Communication and Signal Processing by Volker Ziegler</li>
    <li>6G Challenges and Technology Trends: Signal Processing Perspective by Wen Tong</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are 16 tutorials, 8 expert sessions, 6 panel sessions and 2 forums presenting trending topics of interest to our community with in-depth discussions. Furthermore, 18 industry expert speakers, and 8 grand challenges are included in the ICASSP 2022 program. Also, for the first time in ICASSP, we have 6 education short courses, and an entrepreneurship forum that will be hosted as a pre-conference event.</p>
<p>We would also like to acknowledge the support from the Conference Management Services and Lance Cotton in particular. On behalf of the 12 technical committee chairs; plenary, special session, tutorial, grand challenge, short courses, entrepreneurship, and industry co-chairs, we hope all of you enjoy the high-quality technical program and wish you a fruitful conference. We look forward to welcoming all of you virtually to the Gather.Town, and physically in Singapore in May 2022!</p>
